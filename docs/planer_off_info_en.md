#### Collect off from remote villages
* The program is used for collecting off units from all villages, in distance greater than radius from enemy tribes in first category and the rest in second.
* Distance is calculated in squares.
* The default value of 30 corresponds to approximately 17 hours of a noble's path, for optimization reasons the maximum possible radius is 60.
#### Make sure, that...
* You have included all your own and enemies tribes.
* The selected radius is adequate to the needs.
#### Remember, that...
* The other options are optional.
* More details can be found in the Marks and Examples tab.
