# Public API

There is an option to use the public API. I would be very grateful for reasonable rate limiting and not DDOSing the Tribes Planer servers.

Links:

- [OpenAPI schema - Swagger UI](https://plemiona-planer.pl/api/public/schema/swagger-ui/)
- [OpenAPI schema - Redoc UI](https://plemiona-planer.pl/api/public/schema/redoc/)
- [OpenAPI schema spec yaml file](https://plemiona-planer.pl/api/public/schema)

At the time of writing this article, an endpoint has been added for retrieving full data from the public outline links.
