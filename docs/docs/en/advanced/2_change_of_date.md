# 2. Setting the date

The tab is very simple and is used to change the entry date of the action, which was initially provided at the beginning when creating the outline.

Appearance of the tab with an example date:

There is no and will not be a possibility to outline an action for several days. The only possibility is to outline the action for the first day, e.g., 01.01, send the results to the players, and then in the {==Results Tab==}, after the outline is completed, you can find the remaining, unused units in the {==Unused Troops==} tab. By creating a new outline with a different date, e.g., for the next day 02.01, and copying the data about the Troops there, you can outline the action for the next day.
