# 5. Avoid night bonus

The tab is used to optionally set the option to avoid the night bonus for generated orders for offs and fake offs. Nobles will be outlined normally throughout the day! This does not mean the complete elimination of the possibility of night sends, but only their minimization.

If activated, the Planer will avoid {==sends==} (from the perspective of the player sending attacks, not the defender) during the hours **00:00-07:00**, and it is not possible to change these hours in the current version of the game.

By default, this option is disabled; check the first box to enable it. Since the exact entry times for offs are determined at the very end, in the Times tab, we only provide approximate entry hours for all offs or the majority of them here. For reference, most actions are planned for the morning, e.g., offs enter between 7-11, so we enter such two hours in the form.
