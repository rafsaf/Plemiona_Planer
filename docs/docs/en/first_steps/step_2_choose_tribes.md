# Step 2 - Choosing Tribes

In each outline you should choose the exact tribe or tribes our (attacking) and the opposite (attacked). In the case of several of these, we choose a few. There are exactly two tribes in the World Test, {==ALLY==}  i {==ENEMY==}, we set our tribe as ALLY and the opposite is ENEMY , remembering to click ADD. We will confirm. It is worth remembering that if we do not enter the tribe here and paste its overview into the Army Collection in the next tab, we will get a wall of errors - the Planer always checks whether what the user pastes makes sense - including whether all pasted villages are in one of the given tribes.
