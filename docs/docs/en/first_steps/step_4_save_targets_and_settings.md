# Step 4 - Save targets and settings and write an outline

In the Planer tab, place the targets of the outline as described in the tab, by clicking on {==Save targets==}, we update the targets for which we plan to write outline. By clicking on {==Write an outline==} we finish this part and go to the next tabs. Before starting to write out your own outlines, read the descriptions of the type you are interested in and it's best to experiment in setting different distances from the Front, maximum distances for noblemen, change the advanced modes of the outline, then click Write an outline and in case of unsatisfactory results, return by clicking **Go back**.

On World Test, paste the below data and save.

=== "Reals"

    ```title="targets.txt"
    --8<-- "targets.txt"
    ```

!!! info

    Targets can be pasted in several ways, the easiest way is to paste the next lines as only coords , then by default the number of offs and nobility will be completed as 0. The number of offs and nobility are most easily coded as e.g. `coordinates:2:2` which means `coordinates:two-offs:two-nobles`, or more precisely, the entry `cord:2:1|1|1|1` will mean 2 offs and 1 nobleman from close up, 1 close back, 1 randomly, 1 from away. Enter Fakes and Ruins in the appropriate tabs in the same way.

The whole tab serves mainly two purposes, it is entering targets, and automatic settings for assigning outlines. For the purpose of familiarizing World Test, we will only complete the table with front and back villages, visible under the buttons for saving targets and writing outlines. If you are interested in the other tabs, you can learn more about them in the other parts of the documentation.

Expand the first tab {==1. Available Troops==}. Leave all default values. The goal is to divide all our villages into three groups, Front, Back and Away (very distant) depending on the entered enemy tribes (the distance to the closest enemies is counted for each of our villages). Validate the form by clicking Save and reload troops.

You should see the following results in the table:

Now click now {==Write an outline==}, it's time for the next tab :)

!!! info

    For different outlines, their resolution will be slightly different. For smaller actions, e.g. in the initial stage of worlds, it is worth refining each goal separately in a convenient edition, but for huge actions it is of course impossible, then you should focus more on the tab Planer and the settings available there.
