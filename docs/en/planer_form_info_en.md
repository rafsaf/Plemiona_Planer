#### Write an outline
* Enter your targets with number of offs and nobles with it.
* Correct form in each line is
<span class="md-correct2">Coord:Off:Noble</span>, e.g
<span class="md-correct2">500|500:10:4</span>, see Examples tab.
* Enter fakes targets just like real targets, but under separator line --- which is required
* All front villages will have light blue background later in outline
#### Make sure that...
* Your every target village has been taken into account.
* The coordinates entered by you are correct, which means that such a village exists in the world defined earlier in Outline
#### Remember that...
* You can always come back here after submiting but you will lose your progress.
* Offs below 19k units will not be written out by default
