### Filling with game data

<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-light text-dark"><i class="bi bi-info-square"></i> Using the <b><a target="_blank" href="/documentation#skrypt-zbiorka-wojska-i-obrony">bar script in game</a></b>, after collecting data on players from a tribe (or multiple tribes), paste their results here.</div>

<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-light text-dark"><i class="bi bi-info-square"></i> To go to the <span class="md-error">Planer</span> tab and set up an outline, it is only necessary to complete the <b>Army collection</b>.

### Occurring errors

First of all, assume that it is not a problem on the <b>Planer</b> side and a bug in the website code <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-emoji-smile-upside-down" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M8 1a7 7 0 1 0 0 14A7 7 0 0 0 8 1zm0-1a8 8 0 1 1 0 16A8 8 0 0 1 8 0z"/><path d="M4.285 6.433a.5.5 0 0 0 .683-.183A3.498 3.498 0 0 1 8 4.5c1.295 0 2.426.703 3.032 1.75a.5.5 0 0 0 .866-.5A4.498 4.498 0 0 0 8 3.5a4.5 4.5 0 0 0-3.898 2.25.5.5 0 0 0 .183.683zM7 9.5C7 8.672 6.552 8 6 8s-1 .672-1 1.5.448 1.5 1 1.5 1-.672 1-1.5zm4 0c0-.828-.448-1.5-1-1.5s-1 .672-1 1.5.448 1.5 1 1.5 1-.672 1-1.5z"/></svg>

The most common mistakes are:

<p class = "my-2"> <span class = "md-error"> 1. </span> If everything you entered is wrong, it is likely that the villages you pasted do not belong to the tribes and/or world you declared when creating this lists. </p>
<p class = "my-2"> <span class = "md-error"> 2. </span> Sometimes villages can change owners or players their tribe. Data update runs every few minutes, BUT Tribal Wars offers fresh data only every <b>1 hour</b>. Due to the bug in their infrastructure, this <b><span class = "md-error"> often </span></b> can be shorter period, always look on <u>Last world update: X minute(s) ago.</u> message in the left upper corner. </p>
<p class = "my-2"> <span class = "md-error"> 3. </span> If a large part is wrong and the rest is correct, perhaps a duplicate script output has been pasted, duplicate lines are shown as wrong. </p>

<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-light text-dark"><i class="bi bi-info-square"></i> If none of the above, a little bit of information on what else is checked, along with an example of the text being pasted, you can also find <b><a target="_blank" href="/documentation#uzupelnianie-zbiorki-wojska">here</a></b>. If you feel this is definitely a page error, you should report it on<b>Discord</b>.</div>
