### Create a new outline

<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-light text-dark"><i class="bi bi-info-square"></i> Each new action is another outline.</div>

<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-light text-dark"><i class="bi bi-info-square"></i> Select the date of the outline, the name of it and the world number. The date may be changed at a later time.</div>

<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-light text-dark"><i class="bi bi-info-square"></i> After confirming and then selecting your own and opposing tribes, the created outline will appear in the <span class = "md-error"> My outllines </span> tab.</div>

### Next page

In the next page, select the exact names of your own and opposing tribes. In case of later problems, please refer to the <span class = "md-correct2"> World Test </span> documentation. Remember that you will not be able to change your own and opposing tribes later on.

### Change of the game (country) server

It is possible to change the game server to another, foreign one, such as **www.tribalwars.net**. To change the server, you can click on the button in this tab or go to <span class = "md-correct2"> Menu -> My account </span>.

### Adding new worlds

If one of the worlds is missing, you can add it after going to <span class = "md-correct2"> Menu -> Add world </span> (any user can do it). Its settings, village and player data will be automatically downloaded.
