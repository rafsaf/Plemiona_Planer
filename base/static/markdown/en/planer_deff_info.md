### Collecting deff from the back

<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-light text-dark"><i class="bi bi-info-square"></i> The tab is used to collect defense units from villages at a distance greater than a radius from the enemy tribe as <span class = "md-error"> Back </span>, and at a distance less as <span class = "md-error">Front</span>. This may take a while.</div>

<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-light text-dark"><i class="bi bi-info-square"></i> After successfully creating the report, you will be immediately taken to the <span class = "md-error"> Results </span> tab, <span class = "md-error"> Deff collection </span> tab. In the tab <b> Examples </b> you will find an example of the result.</div>

The distance is shown in boxes. The default value of <span class = "md-correct2"> Radius </span> 10 corresponds to approximately 6 hours for a nobleman on most worlds. To throw out enemy villages that might disturb the result of the division into <span class = "md-error"> Front </span> and <span class = "md-error"> Back </span>, enter their coordinates in the field <span class = "md-correct2">Excluded enemy villages</span>.

### What to use the data from the report for

In a few moments this way you can catch people from the back who have deff, which they shouldn't have in villages, along with the amount of free deff they have. Another use is for picking up free deff before the action. The generated report also includes information on how many villages and permanent deff the player has on the front.
